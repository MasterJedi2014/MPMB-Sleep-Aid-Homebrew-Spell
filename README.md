# MPMB-Sleep-Aid-Homebrew-Spell
Adds a heavily altered version of the Sleep spell to the spell lists of the Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, &amp; Wizard. The intention of this spell is that it is supposed to act like taking a serotonin pill; it is supposed to help people get to sleep.

**Sleep Aid** <br>
*Level 1 Enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 action <br>
**Range:** 90ft. <br>
**Components:** V, S, M (A pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket.)<br>
**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Description:**<br>
This heavily altered version of the Sleep spell aids willing creatures in falling asleep when they would otherwise have difficulty doing so. All willing creatures within 6 meters (20 feet) of a point you choose within range will fall asleep over the course of the next minute.

Creatures that physically cannot fall asleep or enter a similar state of being aren't affected by this spell. Creatures that are immune or resistant to being Charmed, but that do not meet the criteria of the previous sentence, are still affected by this spell if they are willing.
